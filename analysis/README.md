This folder contains scripts for analysing camera data and calibration data using the methods described in the SPECTACLE paper (https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.019075).

Documentation is included in each script, in the form of a header explaining the purpose of the script and how to call it, as well as line-by-line documentation of the code itself.

The following scripts were used to generate the figures from the SPECTACLE paper:
