This folder contains scripts for analysing camera data and calibration data using the methods described in the SPECTACLE paper (https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.019075).

Documentation is included in each script, in the form of a header explaining the purpose of the script and how to call it, as well as line-by-line documentation of the code itself.

The following scripts were used to generate the figures from the SPECTACLE paper:
* Fig.  2: `linearity_characterise_multiple.py`
* Fig.  3: `linearity_plot_response_multiple.py`
* Fig.  4: `linearity_jpeg_sRGB_plot_multi.py` with data from x, y, z
* Fig.  5: `plot_RGBG2_multiple.py`
* Fig.  6: `iso_normalisation_multiple.py`
* Fig.  7: `gain_characterise_multiple.py`
* Fig.  8: `gain_characterise_multiple.py`
* Fig.  9: `flatfield_compare_maps.py`
* Fig. 10: `spectral_response_plot_multiple.py`
* Fig. 11:
