This folder will contain products from one part of the calibration that are used in other parts. The following files may be contained here:

 - bias.npy: stacked per-pixel bias (black level) values
 - ron.npy: per-pixel readout noise values
 - iso_lookup_table.npy: look-up table describing normalization factors at different ISO speeds
 - iso_data.npy: reduced ISO speed / normalization data, for plotting
