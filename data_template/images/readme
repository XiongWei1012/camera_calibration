This folder will contain raw images (DNG/JPG/...) directly from the camera. These will be split into subfolders for different parameters:

 - bias: bias images, split according to ISO
 - dark: dark images, split according to ISO
 - gain: gain images, split according to ISO
 - iso: images, split according to ISO
 - linearity: flat fields, split according to lighting conditions (linear polariser method: split according to angle)
 - flat: flat fields, split according to ISO
 - monochromator: images from a monochromator, split according to grating/filter combination, and then according to wavelength
