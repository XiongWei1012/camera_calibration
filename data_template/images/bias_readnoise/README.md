This folder contains raw *bias* images (DNG) directly from the camera.

There will be subfolders for different ISO values. Each of these is flat and contains a number of images for that particular ISO value.

ISO values are based on app values, not exif values.

The format should be as follows:
.../images/bias/iso<ISO>/
where <ISO> is the ISO value.
