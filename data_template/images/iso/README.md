This folder contains ISO images.

Since these data are used to determine the ISO speed normalisation curve, it is recommended to separate data by ISO speed. Please note that the ISO speed in EXIF data may not be accurate, as shown in the SPECTACLE paper.

The following format is recommended:
.../images/iso/iso<ISO>/*
where <ISO> is the ISO value, and * denotes the location of the image files.
