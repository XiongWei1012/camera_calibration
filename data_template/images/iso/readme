This folder will contain raw images (DNG) directly from the camera.

There will be subfolders for different ISO values.

ISO values are based on app values, not on camera values.

The format should be as follows:
.../images/iso/iso<ISO>/<filename>.<raw>
where <ISO> is the ISO value, <filename> are the individual filenames, and <raw> is the RAW file extension.
