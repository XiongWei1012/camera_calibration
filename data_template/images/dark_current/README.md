This folder contains raw *dark* images (DNG) directly from the camera.

There will be subfolders for different ISO values. Each ISO subfolder is further split into subfolders for different exposure times.

ISO values and exposure times are based on app values, not on camera values.

The format should be as follows:
.../images/dark/iso<ISO>/<invtime>/
where <ISO> is the ISO value and <invtime> is 1/exposure time.
