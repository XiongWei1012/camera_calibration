This folder contains monochromator images. These are used to determine the spectral response of the camera.

It is recommended to separate data according to different grating/filter combinations, and further split them according to wavelength.

The following format is recommended:
.../images/monochromator/<grating_filter>/<wavelength>/*
where <grating_filter> is a combination of grating and filter, <wavelength> is a wavelength in nm, and * denotes the location of the image files.
