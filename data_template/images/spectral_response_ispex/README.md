This folder will contain raw *monochromator* images (DNG) directly from the camera.

There will be subfolders for different grating/filter combinations. These in turn contain subfolders with images, the subfolders corresponding to wavelengths.

The format should be as follows:
.../images/monochromator/<grating_filter>/<wavelength>/*.<raw>
where <grating_filter> is a combination of grating and filter, <wavelength> is a wavelength in nm, and <raw> is the RAW format.
