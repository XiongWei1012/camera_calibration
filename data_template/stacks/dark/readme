This folder will contain stacked *dark* images (NPY) directly from the camera.

There will be subfolders for different ISO values. Each ISO subfolder contains stacked images for different exposure times.

ISO values and exposure times are based on app values, not on camera values.

The format should be as follows:
.../stacks/dark/iso<ISO>/<invtime>_<type>.npy
where <ISO> is the ISO value, <invtime> is 1/exposure time and <type> the image type (see below).

Three types of stacked images will be present:
 - ..._mean.npy: mean per pixel of a data set
 - ..._stds.npy: standard deviation per pixel of a data set
 - ..._colr.npy: Bayer colour per pixel of a data set
