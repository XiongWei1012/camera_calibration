This folder will contain stacked images (NPY) directly from the camera. These will be split into subfolders for different parameters:

 - bias: bias images, split according to ISO
 - dark: dark images, split according to ISO
 - gain: flat fields, split according to ISO
 - linearity: flat fields, split according to lighting conditions (linear polariser method: split according to angle)
 
Three types of stacked images will be present:
 - ..._mean.npy: mean per pixel of a data set
 - ..._stds.npy: standard deviation per pixel of a data set
 - ..._colr.npy: Bayer colour per pixel of a data set
