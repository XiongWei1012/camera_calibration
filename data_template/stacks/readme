This folder will contain stacked images (NPY) directly from the camera. These will be split into subfolders for different parameters:

 - bias: bias files, named according to ISO
 - dark: subfolders containing dark images, split according to ISO
 - gain: subfolders containing files, split according to ISO
 - iso: files, named according to ISO
 - flat: flat fields, split according to ISO
 - linearity: flat fields, split according to lighting conditions (angle/exposure time)
 - monochromator: images from a monochromator, split according to grating/filter combination, and then according to wavelength
 
Furthermore, this folder will contain one file:
 - colour.npy: Bayer colour per pixel of this camera (applies to all contained data sets)
 
In subfolders, two types of stacked images will be present:
 - ..._mean.npy: mean per pixel of a data set
 - ..._stds.npy: standard deviation per pixel of a data set
