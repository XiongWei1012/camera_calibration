This folder will contain stacked *bias* images (NPY) directly from the camera.

There will be files for different ISO values. Each of these is stacked from one data set.

ISO values are based on app values, not exif values.

The format should be as follows:
.../stacks/bias/iso<ISO>_<type>.npy
where <ISO> is the ISO value and <type> the image type (see below).

Three types of stacked images will be present:
 - ..._mean.npy: mean per pixel of a data set
 - ..._stds.npy: standard deviation per pixel of a data set
 - ..._colr.npy: Bayer colour per pixel of a data set
