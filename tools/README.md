## Image stacking

Many of the SPECTACLE calibration and analysis scripts are based on image statistics, such as the mean or standard deviation value per pixel when taking multiple identical exposures. `stack_mean_std.py` is used to generate such image stacks (in NPY format) from a folder structure containing RAW files.

*More documentation to follow soon.*
