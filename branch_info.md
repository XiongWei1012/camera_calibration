This branch represents a major update where calibration methods are integrated into the `Camera` object.

Done:
- Integrate all calibration methods into `Camera`
- Update all scripts to use `Camera`-based calibrations

To do:
- More intuitive `Camera` creation, for example using just a folder name (so the user never sees `root`)
