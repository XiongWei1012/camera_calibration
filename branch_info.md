This branch represents a major update where calibration methods are integrated into the `Camera` object.

- [x] Integrate all calibration methods into `Camera`
- [x] Update all scripts to use `Camera`-based calibrations
- [ ] More intuitive `Camera` creation, for example using just a folder name (so the user never sees `root`)
- [x] Add band information from RawPy to `Camera`
- [ ] Update all documentation
